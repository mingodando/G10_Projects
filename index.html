            What is included in this website:
        </h2>

        <p style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 300px; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
            This website is a learning archive documenting my journey in understanding businesses, financial institutions,
            and capital allocation. Rather than focusing on short-term market performance, I study business models,
            incentives, and durability to improve my judgment over time. Some pieces reflect earlier thinking and
            experimentation.

            Research Coverage:
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Fundamental Analysis:
        </h3>

        <p style="padding-left: 200px;">
            I focus on understanding how businesses actually make money. This includes studying business models,
            competitive advantages, financial strength, and key risks, with an emphasis on whether a company can
            protect capital and compound value over the long term.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Technical Analysis:
        </h3>

        <p style="padding-left: 200px;">
            Technical analysis is used as a supporting tool to observe price behavior, trends, and market sentiment.
            It helps frame timing and positioning, but it never replaces conviction built from fundamentals.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Industry Outlook:
        </h3>

        <p style="padding-left: 200px;">
            Each company is analysed within its broader industry context. I look at long-term structural trends,
            competitive dynamics, and external forces that influence how value is created or destroyed across economic
            cycles.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Concept Notes:
        </h3>

        <p style="padding-left: 200px;">
            This section is more personal and reflective. It captures ideas, lessons, and questions that arise from
            studying businesses, markets, and real-world decision-making. These notes reflect my curiosity about
            capital discipline, responsibility, and why some systems endure while others fail.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Portfolio & Allocation:
        </h3>

        <p style="padding-left: 200px;">
            This section provides a transparent view of how capital is allocated across assets and ideas. The focus is
            not on short-term performance, but on understanding concentration, risk exposure, and how decisions evolve.
