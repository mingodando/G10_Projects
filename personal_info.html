                How I fell in love with programming:
            </h3>
            <p>
                I first learnt about programming was Grade 4, Scratch. I believe all of us have heard of that. I used to 
                be the student in digital design class that wasn't interested in programming. But came G9, a teacher 
                that I will not mention names encouraged me to try programming. I found programming quite fun, using 
                Tkinter to create a simple timer app. Since I'm in IB, I have to do a personal project in G10, I decided
                to do a study application using customTkinter.

                Future Goals:
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am currently working on my study app using Customtkinter. I am now learning Java hoping to change my 
                study app into Java as it would be prettier. Looking to study and improve my Java skills, as well as my
                algorithm skills. This is my first time learning Java, so I am excited to see what I can do with it.
                I also plan to explore web development and learn more about databases.
